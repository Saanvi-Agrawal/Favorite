           I love my hobby reading of books. I love reading whatever I can get my hands on. Reading is a good hobby because it helps me to learn a lot of things. I read a lot of books; fiction, non-fiction, biography, self-help, instructional, etc. I believe everyone should have a reading hobby.

Reading is good because it builds vocabulary, improves reasoning faculties, increases knowledge and teaches different forms of expression. Reading fiction has the ability to transport you to a different world, the world of the author. Your imagination power is enhanced through reading. Readers often tend to become writers because reading activates that part of your brain that leads to coherent thought and expression. The best advice given to writers is to read as much as you can. It is that effective.
